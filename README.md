# Honeypot-Token
ERC-20 standard code to burn 90% of tokens per transfer transaction.
This is a common trick in BSC and is called 'HoneypotToken'.
Although the BURN logic is not implemented within the swap function at this time, it is possible to apply it, and there is ample need to be careful when conducting DEX arbitrage.
